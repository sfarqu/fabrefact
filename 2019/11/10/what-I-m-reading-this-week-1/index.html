<li><p><a href="https://chelseatroy.com/category/leveling-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelsea Troy’s whole Leveling Up series</a> is exactly the sort of thing I dreamed of writing when I thought about starting a blog.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Getting back to <a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory</a>, Ulrich Drepper’s enormous paper about the foundational workings of computers. I keep putting it down and haring off on tangents about how much has changed since 2007, but I’ve promised my paper reading group that I will get through all 50-odd pages and summarize it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chelsea Troy’s three-part <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/08/01/api-design-part-1-before-there-was-rest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history of web API design</a> is the first thing that ever made GraphQL click for me.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not to diminish this <a href="https://twitter.com/hexrcs/status/1190332090149150720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-tweet crash course in GraphQL</a> by Xiaoru Li, which packs a lot of information into few words, but still uses a bit too much jargon to be a good introduction.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/science-tech/article/45942/1/your-period-tracker-app-might-be-sharing-your-data-to-facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Your period tracker might be sharing your sensitive data with Facebook</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This seems obvious in retrospect, and with Google buying Fitbit, I’ve been thinking a lot about how I don’t really <em>need</em> to track my health data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.leanessays.com/2019/04/what-if-your-team-wrote-code-for-737.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What If Your Team Wrote the Code for the 737 MCAS System?</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t write code for airplane controls, but the lessons of the 737 MAX and the Uber pedestrian death should be a reminder to all software developers that you are never <em>just</em> an engineer. Software has consequences, and we should be thinking about the effects of what we build.</li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/08/10/leisure-the-basis-of-culture-josef-pieper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leisure, the Basis of Culture: An Obscure German Philosopher’s Timely 1948 Manifesto for Reclaiming Our Human Dignity in a Culture of Workaholism</a></p>
<ul>
<li>To be honest I don’t think I could read this Josef Pieper book without considering it <em>work</em>, but the reviewer clearly enjoyed it, and I find it useful to occasionally reflect on how much I am conceding to the Cult of Productivity.</li>

<li><p><a href="https://timewitch.net/post/2019-11-03-when-cache-is-a-db/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When a Cache is a Database</a>, Vallery Lancey’s neat post about the importance of making correct assumptions about the availability of services in production.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/storage-algorithms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algorithms behind Modern Storage Systems</a>, transcript of a talk by Alex Petrov</p>
<ul>
<li>Coincidentally, yesterday my coworker recommended Petrov’s new book Database Internals, which is the same book mentioned in this 2018 talk! I was very tired when I skimmed this talk transcript, so I look forward to reading the book and understanding a bit better.</li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Phoenix Project</a> by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford</p>
<ul>
<li>This book was recommended to me, and I kept seeing people talking up the sequel, <em>The Unicorn Project</em>. I’m not sure I got a lot out of it, since I am already aware of concepts like DevOps and the novel is a little formulaic—but at the same time I did read the whole book in one sitting, so I can see how it could be a more engaging introduction to the topic than a dry textbook.</li>
</ul>

<li><p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90422553/the-first-map-of-americas-food-supply-chain-is-mind-boggling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The first map of America’s food supply chain is mind-boggling</a></p>
<ul>
<li>This reads to me as “how to disrupt America’s food supply chain” but maybe I’m just pessimistic</li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6570502-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch: how to change things when change is hard</a> by Chip Heath &amp; Dan Heath (audiobook)</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem with reading one self-help book that debunks the theory of willpower exhaustion (Indistractable) is that every other self-help book published in the last 20 years uses willpower exhaustion as a foundation of their thesis, and <em>Switch</em> is no exception. This is probably my own fault for enjoying pop-science books in the first place. However, once I decided to let slide the dubious science and tortuous elephant-and-rider metaphor, there is some reasonable advice for how to implement change in an organization. Still have a few hours left in this one.</li>

<ul>
<li>When I saw Urs Hölzle’s tweet saying <a href="https://twitter.com/uhoelzle/status/1177360023976067077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RIP MapReduce</a> I was a little disoriented, having just finished a Coursera course on Cloud Computing that taught MapReduce as an important topic in Big Data. In an effort to find my footing again I searched for a summary of the current state of data processing. This article about the decline of Hadoop is the closest to what I was looking for. I guess this tech still exists, but is used in managed services instead of directly? My main takeaway is that by the time a specialization becomes popular on Coursera, much of what it says is probably outdated.</li>
