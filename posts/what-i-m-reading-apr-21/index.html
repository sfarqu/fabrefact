    <p>I got busy and then the world kind of collapsed. For a while I couldn't care about much outside my immediate field of vision, but now I've settled into the new life of working remote and idly stressing about a different set of problems. I still have a job, might as well read more and try to get better at it.</p>
<h2 id="completed-books">Completed Books</h2>
<p>I have been reading a lot of fiction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was lucky enough to get an advance copy of Martha Wells&rsquo; new Murderbot novella <a href="https://publishing.tor.com/networkeffect-marthawells/9781250229861/">Network Effect</a> and it was everything I wanted a new Murderbot book to be.</li>
<li>Picked Elizabeth Moon's <a href="http://www.elizabethmoon.com/books-serrano.html#hero">Once a Hero</a> off my bookshelf and read most of it, then went on a bit of a kick and re-read <a href="http://www.elizabethmoon.com/books-paksworld.html#surrender">Surrender None</a> and the end of <a href="http://www.elizabethmoon.com/books-paksworld.html#liar">Liar's Oath</a> before discovering that there are new books in the world of Paksenarrion. I borrowed the entire <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/49609-paladin-s-legacy">Paladin's Legacy series</a> from the library.
<ul>
<li>Oath of Fealty</li>
<li>Kings of the North</li>
<li>Echoes of Betrayal</li>
<li>Limits of Power</li>
<li>Crown of Renewal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stumbled across a blog post by Jenny Trout and ended up reading the first two books in her <a href="http://jennytrout.com/?page_id=10585">The Boss series</a> (as Abigail Barnette), sold by the concept of &ldquo;if 50 Shades of Grey was written by someone who knows how kink works&rdquo; and the fact that the first book was free. Not my normal genre but pleasingly well-written, covering a lot of complex topics and modelling of healthy communication. May not read any more though, contemporary romance isn't my jam.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="current-books">Current Books</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="">Programmed Inequality: How Britain discarded women technologists and lost its edge in computing</a> (audiobook) by Marie Hicks. I was so excited about this based on the excerpt I read, but the audiobook is a bit of a slog. Not sure if it's the narration or the pacing of the book itself, but I have trouble paying attention. A shame, because there's a ton of fascinating historical detail buried in here!</li>
<li>Picked <a href="https://dataintensive.net/">Designing Data-Driven Applications</a> back up. Still quite enjoyable, though this chapter on consensus feels familiar after all the classes I took last year.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="articles">Articles</h2>
<p>Deliberately reading things that are <em>not</em> about current events, but not entirely avoiding the topic.</p>
<h3 id="covid19">COVID-19</h3>
<ul>
<li>A summary by Tiernan Ray of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/ai-runs-smack-up-against-a-big-data-problem-in-covid-19-diagnosis/">the problems of using AI for COVID-19 diagnosis</a></li>
<li>I read a lot of DIY mask tutorials, but Beth Darrah's <a href="https://slyfoxfabrics.com/blogs/mash-ups/the-ten-minute-mask-by-beth-darrah">Ten-Minute Mask</a> was one of the cleanest. I used my own pattern, but it's helpful to see how other people are approaching the issue of cloth masks.</li>
<li>Most important tutorial: <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/how-to-wear-mask-glasses-no-fogging-up">How to wear a mask without fogging up your glasses</a> by Magdalene Taylor</li>
<li>My Twitter timeline has been full of information and ideas on contact-tracing apps to minimize the spread of COVID-19, but I work with tracking software on a regular basis so it was validating to see this ACLU white paper on <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/aclu-white-paper-limits-location-tracking-epidemic?redirect=aclu-white-paper-limits-location-tracking-epidemic">The Limits of Location Tracking in an Epidemic</a> by Jay Stanley and Jennifer Stisa Granick, which brings up all the caveats I had considered, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clare Sudbery wrote a helpful practical example of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/class-too-large.html">refactoring a too-large class</a> for martinfowler.com. I enjoy seeing real-life examples of theories I've read about.</li>
<li>The title <a href="https://github.blog/2020-04-09-from-48k-lines-of-code-to-10-the-story-of-githubs-javascript-sdk/">From 48K lines of code to 10</a> is clickbait, since Gregor Martynus just moved all the code from a monolithic library to a bunch of plugins. Still, I found it timely since I have to write an app for the GitHub API and was looking at their SDKs anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="random-technical-posts">Random technical posts</h3>
<ul>
<li>In my new life working on Developer Experience I have to draw a lot more diagrams than I was accustomed to as a software developer. For that reason I paid attention to <a href="https://medium.com/@emalone/using-modeling-to-understand-whats-happening-within-a-system-bb5b9f4fc128">Using Modeling to Understand What's Happening in a System</a>, though I can't think of where I'd use any of these particular diagrams.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/marketing-yourself/">How to market yourself without being a celebrity</a> Shawn Wang argues that it's important to find a niche and stick to it, which is why I'll never be famous in tech.</li>
<li>I enjoyed Dave Nicolette's clarification of the purpose of <a href="https://neopragma.com/2020/04/code-katas/">code katas</a>. Makes me want to get in the habit of doing them.</li>
<li>Lydia Hallie made some cool <a href="https://dev.to/lydiahallie/cs-visualized-useful-git-commands-37p1">visualizations of git commands</a> like merge, rebase, and cherry-pick. The more ways to model a concept I'm learning, the better!</li>
<li>I like the idea of observability that Honeycomb advocates, but the definition still feels a bit slippery if you're not using their service. I appreciated Andy Dote's <a href="https://andydote.co.uk/2020/03/15/observability-without-honeycomb/">Observability without Honeycomb</a>. Turns out yes, we already do something like this, though I have ideas to improve it.</li>
<li>Stack Overflow's <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/09/the-unfriendly-robot-automatically-flagging-unwelcoming-comments/">Unfriendly Robot: automatically flagging unwelcoming comments</a> by Jason Punyon and Kevin Montrose is a fun overview of the context and results of implementing an AI comment-flagging system.</li>
<li>Zara Cooper's <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/06/a-practical-guide-to-writing-technical-specs/">practical guide to writing technical specs</a> contains far more than I have ever put into a spec and now I want to go back and fix them. Wish I'd found this when I was first made responsible for designing features!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-new-work-reality">The new work reality</h3>
<ul>
<li>It's impossible to not sound like a robot when talking about layoffs, but Nobl's <a href="https://academy.nobl.io/how-to-layoff-employees-in-a-humane-way/">How to Layoff Employees in a Humane Way</a> at least sounds like an <em>ethical</em> robot? I am very lucky that this article doesn't have any meaning for me personally, but I'm thinking a lot about everyone I know who has been on one side or another of pandemic-related downsizing.</li>
<li>Antonio Bertossi's <a href="https://www.kinandcarta.com/en/insights/2020/04/bolster-remote-leadership/">Six tips to bolster remote leadership and promote trust</a> have a common thread of &ldquo;be direct, communicate clearly, ditch unnecessary extras&rdquo;. Good points to keep in mind as the weeks of remote work roll on.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="papers">Papers</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06358.pdf">Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes</a> by Nuno Preguica, Carlos Baquero, and Marc Shapiro was not illuminating. Maybe if I keep looking at <a href="https://crdt.tech/">https://crdt.tech/</a> I will start to intuit how CRDTs actually work, instead of just the idealistic theory.</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04145">Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports: Anonymization Process Description</a> by A. Aktay et al. Only skimmed this, but it was interesting to see a real-world implementation of differential privacy. Useful context for looking at the <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/">actual mobility reports</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DP-3T/documents/blob/master/DP3T%20White%20Paper.pdf">Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T) whitepaper</a> by Prof. Carmela Troncoso et al was a fascinating look at a lot of threat models I hadn't heard of. Didn't get around to reading it before Apple and Google announced their respective contact-tracing frameworks that use a similar Bluetooth beacon approach, but I'm glad I finally dug into it.</li>
