    <p>I spent all of yesterday defrosting my fridge instead of writing a blog post, but on my list of things to do both of those things count as accomplishments. I'm making a tiny bit of progress on my backlog of half-completed ideas.</p>
<p>I've been following along with the protests in Nigeria via Twitter, but don't have any good links to share about it except the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EndSARS">#EndSARS hashtag</a>.</p>
<h1 id="articles">Articles</h1>
<h2 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nikhyl Singhal provides a framework to <a href="https://theskip.substack.com/p/stage-of-company-not-name-of-company">categorize what growth stage a company is in</a> and deciding which stages fit your current career ambitions, as a way to make better choices when searching for a new role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Cutler outlines a framework for <a href="https://amplitude.com/blog/asking-better-questions">getting people to ask better questions in a workshop</a>, which seems useful reading for facilitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I signed up for Stephen P. Anderson's Mighty Minds Club, but honestly there's so much content I often don't have time to absorb it. I'm very glad I took the time for Anderson's <a href="https://medium.com/@stephenanderson/hopeful-and-powerless-design-in-a-crisis-bb867bba9ff1">transcript of his <em>Hopeful and Powerless? Design in a Crisis</em> keynote</a> thoughâ€”there's a lot of tangents and frameworks and things to think about, but the overall message is answering the question &ldquo;how do I do work in today's world?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="commentary-on-tech-news">Commentary on tech news</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kat Maddox is consistently hilarious on Twitter, and that follows through into her newsletter, <a href="https://leftalign.substack.com/p/kill-pods-in-your-kubernetes-cluster">the most recent of which</a> caught my attention by introducing me to an open-source project that lets you kill kubernetes pods by shooting them in Doom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw some of Emily Kager's <a href="https://twitter.com/EmilyKager/status/1314376945765810179?s=20">satirical TikToks</a> before reading her post about <a href="https://www.emilykager.com/writing/2020/10/08/virality.html">going viral as a woman in tech</a>, and almost didn't read it because I knew what to expect. There was a surprisingly positive twist to the story though!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Felienne has a great rant about <a href="https://www.felienne.com/archives/3355">why blaming Excel or its users for data problems is pointless</a>, which became relevant again with the recent spreadsheet error that misplaced Covid-19 testing data in the UK.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-rabbit-holes">Technical rabbit holes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The topic of &ldquo;why did MySQL ever get so popular&rdquo; has come across my radar multiple ways in the past few weeks. For me it was the only database I was really introduced to and thus the only one I knew, but posts like Gabriel Maia's deep dive into <a href="https://gbl08ma.com/time-for-a-wtf-mysql-moment/">why MySQL's TIME type can only handle intervals of slightly less than 35 days</a> really make me wonder&hellip;why <em>is</em> MySQL so popular?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eugene Wei analyses <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/9/18/seeing-like-an-algorithm">why TikTok's design is particularly tailored to feed the algorithm information about what you want to watch</a>, which I found interesting, especially since I have never used TikTok and am unfamiliar with its UX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mike Hoye <a href="http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/">dives deep into the history of why zero-indexed arrays were invented</a>, and along the way dunks on programmers&rsquo; attachment to folk tales and the difficulty of accessing historical sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was fascinated by Rhodri Leng's <a href="https://www.the-matter-of-facts.com/amp/the-phantom-reference-and-the-propagation-of-error">analysis of the phantom reference</a>, a fictional paper from a style guide that has accidentally been cited by non-fictional works nearly 500 times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="developer-learning">Developer learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nicolas Carlo has a neat <a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/key-points-of-legacy-code-programmer-toolbox/">summary of The Legacy Code Programmer's Toolbox by Jonathan Roccara</a> which covers at a high level a bunch of techniques for learning how to work with legacy code. I love legacy code, so I enjoyed this post and am now interested in the book!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neil Kakkar has a <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html">long list of things he's learned in the last year</a>, which I'm a little envious of. I wish I took better notes when I first started as a developer!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leadership">Leadership</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chris Schillinger writes about his idea of <a href="https://medium.com/flatiron-engineering/abstract-management-interfaces-7bf70431450">&ldquo;Abstract Management Interfaces&rdquo;</a>, which seems to be a way of framing &ldquo;separate results from techniques when judging performance&rdquo; in a way that is satisfying to brains that are used of thinking in engineering terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mikio L. Braun <a href="https://margint.blog/2020/10/07/some-thoughts-on-the-principal-role/">muses about what Principal roles are and are not</a>, nothing particularly groundbreaking but I like to read a lot of perspectives on how to succeed at this sort of role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anna Shipman has an interesting post on <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/meeting-everyone.html">why senior leaders should meet one-to-one with everyone on their new team if it's fewer than 150 people</a>. It's an interesting take and has lots of practical tips about how to make it functional.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="better-communication">Better communication</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stephanie Morillo provides a <a href="https://www.stephaniemorillo.co/post/7-pieces-of-information-to-include-in-technical-blog-posts">helpful list of information to include in your technical blog posts</a> if you don't want to annoy developers reading it in the future. I found myself emphatically agreeing with a few of these!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dvir Segal outlines <a href="https://medium.com/@dvirsegal/congratulations-and-welcome-aboard-e936f948a173">what a good onboarding plan should look like</a> which is relevant to me as someone who wants to improve onboarding!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tanya S has a presentation on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RwK7S5GMvbS1ZVamdZbU9qbXc/view">using storytelling methods to make a compelling presentation</a>, something I may not be very good at.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="philosophical-thoughts-on-computing">Philosophical thoughts on computing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shreya Shankar muses on Twitter about <a href="https://twitter.com/sh_reya/status/1314338372073263112?s=20">what constitutes a source of truth for a machine learning model</a> when you can get different results every time you run the same code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thea Flowers has a very interesting take on <a href="https://blog.thea.codes/we-need-to-talk-about-github/">the downside of centralized source code hosting like GitHub</a>, with a quick little history of version control, and some dreams of possible alternate futures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah Lim <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/sliminality/status/1317331148360437760">defends dynamically-typed languages</a> for their contributions to her preferred static types.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="i-couldnt-think-of-a-common-theme-for-these">I couldn't think of a common theme for these</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This article about <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/want-to-be-happier-make-more-free-time">how free time is the key to happiness</a> is mostly a promo for Ashley Whillans&rsquo; book on the topic, but it does contain some reasonable strategies for making the most of your time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ronnie Flathers post on <a href="https://blog.ropnop.com/storing-tokens-in-browser/">all the ways to store session tokens in Javascript</a> and their security implications is exactly the type of content I wish I could have found when I was first starting to do professional Javascript development. He doesn't go into other complications like cross-browser support or private browsing mode, and his recommended techniques have some pretty serious drawbacks (a session that can't survive a page refresh?!), but it's neat to see a bunch of pros and cons laid out.</p>
