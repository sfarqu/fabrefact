<p>R. Eric Thomas's essay <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/amp32733422/on-protest-and-progress/">When All Of This Is Over: On The Narrative Of Protest And Progress</a> reflects on the question: will this current movement result in actions to end white supremacy, or will we just go back to &ldquo;normal&rdquo;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59ead8f9692ebee25b72f17f/t/5b65cd58758d46d34254f22c/1533398363539/CR_NoCops_reform_vs_abolition_CRside.pdf">Abolitionist Reforms Chart</a> from <a href="http://criticalresistance.org">Critical Resistance</a> helped me frame why some suggested police reforms don't actually lead to meaningful change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kurt Kemple's <a href="https://theworst.dev/a-plea-for-action/">Plea for Action</a> suggests steps that tech companies must take if they truly mean the statements in their corporate &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; posts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Captain Awkward points out that <a href="https://captainawkward.com/2020/06/05/1272-white-family-facebook-drama-over-police-racism/">arguing with your racist white family members on Facebook maybe isn't the best use of your time</a> and provides tangible actions to consider instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annie D'Souza writes <a href="http://www.themidwestival.com/blog/2020/6/how-to-find-your-place-in-the-social-change-ecosystem">how to find your place in the social change ecosystem</a> and points out some of the useful roles in a social movement that don't involve going to protests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From The Midwestival I discovered the Building Movement Project, and Deepa Iyer's post <a href="https://buildingmovement.org/blog/beyond-hashtags-and-slogans-when-solidarity-becomes-transformative/">Beyond Hashtags and Slogans: When Solidarity Becomes Transformative</a>. Need to read more from this site.</p>

<li>
<p>Barack Obama suggests <a href="https://medium.com/@BarackObama/how-to-make-this-moment-the-turning-point-for-real-change-9fa209806067">making this moment the turning point for real change</a> will require both protest and political action. A bit of a moderate statement, but well-worded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michelle Weber collects a long <a href="https://kingofstates.com/2020/06/01/racial-justice-a-list-of-resources-for-white-people-who-are-not-on-twitter-24-hours-a-day/">list of resources for white people who are not on Twitter 24 hours a day</a>, which is a great list and a great title.</p>

<p>Rachel Hands points out in her post <a href="https://rachelhands.com/2020/06/02/on-anti-racist-management-practices/">on anti-racist management practices</a> that leaders have a responsibility to do more than just be not-racist, and points to some good resources for managers looking to do better at creating an inclusive work environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ben French has three lessons for <a href="https://www.opml.co.uk/blog/making-teams-work-in-volatile-and-uncertain-environments">building teams that can adapt to change</a>, which is a little focused on government/policy initiatives but could work for tech teams too</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="effective-engineering">Effective engineering</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aleksandra Sikora in the spicily-named <a href="https://www.aleksandra.codes/tech-content-consumer">Most tech content is bullshit</a> points out why we shouldn't blindly copy-paste solutions we find on the internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toby W has tips on <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/drawing-good-architecture-diagrams">drawing good architecture diagrams</a>, which mostly comes down to &ldquo;keep it simple&rdquo;</p>
</li>

<p>Julia Evans describes her process for writing <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/06/14/questions-to-help-you-learn/">questions to help people decide what to learn</a> and what she learned from the process.</p>

<p>Matt Belcher lists <a href="https://codurance.com/2020/06/09/signs-your-software-is-rotting/">signs your software is rotting</a> and some tools to address software rot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phil Sturgeon's long list of <a href="https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/theres-no-reason-to-write-openapi-by-hand">the benefits and pitfalls of different techniques to automate writing OpenAPI specs</a> is one of many articles on <a href="https://apisyouwonthate.com/">APIs you won't hate</a>, which seems to be a useful resource for anyone who writes APIs</p>

<h2 id="big-ideas-in-tech">Big ideas in tech</h2>

<li>
<p>Greg Epstein, TechCrunch's Ethicist in Residence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/13/so-you-want-to-talk-about-race-in-tech-with-ijeoma-oluo/">interviewed author Ijeoma Oluo about ethics in tech</a>, which left me wanting to know more about how tech and the internet are designed and used in non-Western regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesse Li's long essay <a href="https://blog.jse.li/posts/software/">Where Did Software Go Wrong?</a> meditates on how software cannot be separated from human voices and systems, but stops short of suggesting answers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love the phrase <em>omnia contexta sunt</em> from John D Cooks&rsquo; post on <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2020/01/16/memento-complexitatis/">having reminders that the world is complex</a>. The aphorism, proposed by Latin scholar Lily Hart, literally means &ldquo;all things have been braided&rdquo;, thus suggesting not only complexity, but interdependence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="coding-tools">Coding tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interesting to see projects like <a href="https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/">OSS Review Toolkit</a> trying to automate cross-language FOSS license compliance checks and security advisories (project currently incomplete)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New edition of <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">Thoughtworks Technology Radar</a> includes a lot of Kubernetes, ethical bias testing, and a sudden uptick in remote work tooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Techradar seems to be an annoying site that tries to embed as many links to their other articles as actual content, this <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/open-source-software-vulnerabilities-see-huge-rise">summary of findings from RiskSense's new report &ldquo;The Dark Reality of Open Source&rdquo;</a> at least doesn't require your email to see it, unlike <a href="https://info.risksense.com/open-source-spotlight-report-pr">the report itself</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/08/facebooks-transcoder-ai-converts-code-from-one-programming-language-into-another/">Venturebeat summary</a> of the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03511">Unsupervised Translation of Programming Languages</a> contains some credulous quotes about how AI will allow non-technical users to write expert code, but it does contain the bare bones of how Facebook's transcompiler was trained using unsupervised machine learning and gets decent results.</p>
