    <p>Instead of posting a reading list on Sunday I instead read 5 books, so while I feel like I haven't gotten much reading done that's not entirely correct.</p>
<h2 id="completed-books">Completed Books</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34762552-algorithms-of-oppression">Algorithms of Oppression: how search engines reinforce racism</a> by Safiya Umoja Noble. A little more dry and academic than I was expecting, but I did learn some things about how algorithms intersect poorly with marginalised identities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-read Martha Wells <a href="https://www.marthawells.com/murderbot.htm">Murderbot Diaries</a> novellas for at least the second, possibly third time. I deeply enjoy this character and this world, and the novellas are quick so they make good stress reads.</p>
<ul>
<li>All Systems Red</li>
<li>Artificial Condition</li>
<li>Rogue Protocol</li>
<li>Exit Strategy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42036538-gideon-the-ninth">Gideon the Ninth</a> by Tamsyn Muir was nothing at all like what I expected, despite being exactly what all my friends described it as. Perhaps not <em>exactly</em> alike. Billed as &ldquo;lesbian necromancers in space&rdquo;, while they technically <em>do</em> go to space for half a page, it is primarily a sword-and-sorcery Clue-style mystery</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="articles">Articles</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A disheartening but ultimately positively-framed retraction from Dr. Kate Laskowski about <a href="https://laskowskilab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/2020/01/29/retractions/">how she discovered that a collaborator faked the data for some of their research papers</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vicki Boykis <a href="https://vicki.substack.com/p/one-very-bad-apple">tears apart Apple's ostensible &ldquo;commitment to privacy&rdquo;</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discovered Lara Hogan's blog via Twitter, and liked this post about <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/benefits-offering-challenges/">how to offer challenges to your teammates</a> and this one about <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/how-to-manage-up/">how to manage up</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Level Up newsletter linked to this Madeleine Dore article with the promising title of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200130-the-life-hack-to-reduce-admin-and-carve-out-downtime">How to reduce &lsquo;attention residue&rsquo; in your life</a>, but it mostly talks up a particular program offered at University of Melbourne, and is low on practical advice for the average person.</p>
<ul>
<li>tl;dr schedule a chunk of time regularly to knock off half-a-dozen or so small life admin tasks and you'll feel more in control of your life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quinn Crossley wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@quinncrossley/uplifting-diverse-genders-beyond-women-and-non-binary-916c890f2185">how &ldquo;Women and Non-Binary&rdquo; is not the best way to be inclusive</a>, including a few clear steps about how to make your communities more welcome to all genders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This <a href="https://blog.tidelift.com/open-source-licenses-2019-year-in-review">2019 year in review of open source licenses</a> by Luis Villa gives some context for the Hippocratic License I stumbled upon recently, as well as many other details about open source licenses that I didn't know until now!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alex Pareto wrote a quick blog post on <a href="https://alexpareto.com/scalability/systems/2020/02/03/scaling-100k.html">how to scale an app from 1 to 100K users</a>. It summarizes commonly used architecture patterns for each stage of growth, with a few nods to specific technologies and where they fit into the picture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this podcast excerpt Kelsey Hightower shares his unpopular opinion that <a href="https://changelog.com/posts/monoliths-are-the-future">monoliths are the future</a>, aka microservices and kubernetes won't save you from bad architecture decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After listening to <em>Brotopia</em> I had a tiny bit of context for how startup VC works so Alex Danco's post about <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/02/07/debt-is-coming/">how the software startup world needs a financial realignment</a> wasn't <em>completely</em> over my head, but I still glazed over a lot of the specifics about production capital and liquidity preferences. However this line made me crack up: <em>“Don’t take debt” is tech’s “Four legs good, two legs bad.”</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Janelle Shane has produced another work of horrifying genius by <a href="https://aiweirdness.com/post/190721709472/ai-vintage-american-cooking-a-combination-that">training the GPT-2 neural net on a collection of vintage American recipes involving gelatin</a></p>
</li>

<p>Tanya Reilly describes fighting through organizational friction as <a href="https://noidea.dog/blog/surviving-the-organisational-side-quest">side quests in a point-and-click adventure game</a> and is absolutely right. This is the kind of frustrating side quest I'm aiming to reduce in my new role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still don't know what Project Zero is, but this is an incredible deep dive into <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/02/several-months-in-life-of-part1.html">how they tracked down an obscure Chrome buffer overflow bug</a> which I definitely didn't fully understand but has some interesting insight into debugging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of debugging, Chelsea Troy, seemingly partially talked into it by Twitter, posted a <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/01/27/the-case-of-the-failing-upload-part-1/">debugging case study in the form of a murder mystery</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An interesting (and sad) conclusion from The Atlantic about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/how-boeing-lost-its-bearings/602188/">why Boeing lost its focus on engineering and safety</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reading <em>Systems Performance</em> I have a much clearer idea what it means that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-deprecating-macos-kernel-extensions-kexts-is-a-great-win-for-security/">Apple is deprecating macOS kernel extensions</a>, and how that is both good for security and bad for certain types of tooling.</p>
