    <p>Last week I got access back to my company&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Reilly books subscription after a licensing hiccup, so I finally got back to Brendan Gregg&rsquo;s <em>Systems Performance</em>! Still managed to find time for some other reading though.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41104130-ten-drugs">Ten Drugs: How Plants, Powders, and Pills Have Shaped the History of Medicine</a></em> (audiobook) was a rollicking romp through the history of drug companies, accidental discoveries, and unintended side-effects. The author states at the beginning that this is more of a pop book than a science book, but I still learned a lot, and forgave a little pointless meandering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tried for-real pair programming for the first time recently and found it quite valuable, so <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html">On Pair Programming</a> by Birgitta Böckeler and Nina Siessegger came about at a good time, even if it seems to assume an organisation where pairing is the norm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rina Artstain has thoughts about how to apply <a href="https://medium.com/@rinaarts/radical-candor-software-edition-d4b5ad401be3">Radical Candor to software development</a>. Lots here that I should work on, since my natural tendency is to avoid confrontation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly the sort of person who follows RFC drafts, so this <a href="https://twitter.com/jasnell/status/1217620376747827200?s=20">Twitter rant by James Snell</a> is the first time it clicked that HTTP/3 will use the QUIC protocol, which I read a paper about not long ago. I still don&rsquo;t know about QPACK and stateful header compression, which according to this are overly-complicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I said last week that I love when conference talks are turned into blog posts; this week I found Clint Gibler summarized <a href="https://tldrsec.com/blog/appsec-cali-2019/">every talk from AppSec Cali 2019</a> into a giant blog post, and it is <em>great</em>!  AppSec California sounds like a great conference, and a lot of the summarised talks are directly relevant to a project I&rsquo;m helping out with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lynn Cyrin had some quick thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/lynncyrin/status/1217726716828737536?s=20">how the infrastructure engineer role is changing</a>. I hope they write that blog post and go more into depth on this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I normally am not super interested in &ldquo;how I work&rdquo;-type posts, but this <a href="http://phdtalk.blogspot.com/2020/01/i-am-felienne-hermans-and-this-is-how-i.html?m=1">interview with Felianne Hermans</a> introduced me to the Goodnotes app, which I immediately downloaded because taking handwritten notes and annotating PDFs are the main uses I have found for my iPad, and an app that renders my handwriting searchable is golden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Christian Posta breaks down <a href="https://blog.christianposta.com/microservices/istio-as-an-example-of-when-not-to-do-microservices/">why it made sense for Istio to ditch the complexity of a microservice architecture</a> as an example of how to pick the best architecture for your product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kristian Köhntopp turned a long tweet thread into a post about <a href="http://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/01/17/rolling-back-a-rollout.html">how to achieve reliable rollbacks</a>, which mostly comes down to separating deploy from activation, appropriate feature flagging, and good observability (using Charity Majors' definition of &ldquo;observability&rdquo;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liz Rice <a href="https://medium.com/@lizrice/go-slices-maps-pitfalls-and-generics-f7ced963ced">gets into the weeds about array slices in Go</a>, which is pretty technical but I hope will somehow help me absorb enough Go by osmosis that when I finally come up with a project to build in Go I will have less trouble with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stumbled across this older John Allspaw piece about <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-infinite-hows/">why &ldquo;how&rdquo; is a better question than &ldquo;why&rdquo; in incident review</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through the Level Up newsletter I keep finding articles a little above my weight class, but I still found Will Larson&rsquo;s article about <a href="https://lethain.com/first-ninety-days-cto-vpe/">what to do in your first 90 days as CTO</a> interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mekka Okereke has a great Twitter thread for managers about how to make your team more inclusive by <a href="https://twitter.com/mekkaokereke/status/1218940982122577921?s=20">ensuring stretch opportunities are evenly distributed</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alexis King goes way into depth about <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/01/19/no-dynamic-type-systems-are-not-inherently-more-open/">dynamic type systems are not inherently better at modelling real-world data</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quincy Larson&rsquo;s story about how <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/stopping-credit-card-fraud-and-saving-our-nonprofit/">fraudulent donations came close to bankrupting his nonprofit</a> is a nailbiter with a happy ending.</p>
</li>
</ul>
