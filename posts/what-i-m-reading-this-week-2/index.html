<li>I wanted to quickly check my intuition that Rust doesn't have garbage collection and instead found this <a href="https://words.steveklabnik.com/borrow-checking-escape-analysis-amd-the-generational-hypothesis">Steve Klabnik essay</a> about that and a lot more. The takeaway I think is that Rust's static memory management makes GC redundant?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There was a lot of hoopla about the implicit algorithmic bias in the new Apple Card, but I found <a href="https://dhh.dk/2019/about-the-apple-card.html">Jamie Heinemeier Hansson's post</a> particularly incisive. Especially the widely-quoted &ldquo;justice for another rich white woman is not justice at all.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/parallel-commits">Parallel Commits: An Atomic Commit Protocol For Globally Distributed Transactions</a>
<ul>
<li>Cockroach Labs has this amazing blog full of crunchy technical details of design decisions they've made when building CockroachDB, their distributed database product. I loved this deep dive into the complex intersection of atomic transactions and distributed consensus, with a brief sidebar into using TLA+ for formal verification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3359656">File Systems Unfit as Distributed Storage Backends: Lessons from 10 Years of Ceph Evolution</a>
<ul>
<li>Having just learned about Ceph in a cloud computing course and read Alex Petrov's talk transcript about storage systems last week, I was in a much better position to understand this paper! I also leaned on the <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/11/06/ceph-evolution/">summary from The Morning Paper</a> for some of the highlights.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also helpful for getting a handle on file systems was this <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Foone/status/1194762568948056064?s=20">cool tweet thread about formatting floppy disks</a></li>
<li>I keep meaning to dig more into <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/vaidehijoshi">Vaidehi Joshi</a>&lsquo;s BaseCS series, so today I randomly started with her <a href="https://medium.com/basecs/leveling-up-ones-parsing-game-with-asts-d7a6fc2400ff">intro to abstract syntax trees</a>. It probably would have been better to start with the preceeding articles about parsers, but I've had to interact with ASTs and parsers enough at work to have a basic foundation.</li>
