    <p>Was feeling ambitious after my last post and immediately started reading more of my bookmarks. Also took the time to note down all of the books I read last week, since my Kindle failed to mark them as read in Goodreads. Technology, never as convenient as you want it to be.</p>
<h1 id="books">Books</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure if I <em>like</em> the universe of Tamsyn Muir&rsquo;s Locked Tomb Trilogy? But I did read <a href="https://publishing.tor.com/harrowtheninth-tamsynmuir/9781250313225/"><em>Harrow the Ninth</em></a> in one uninterrupted sitting as soon as the preorder downloaded itself to my kindle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/634438/the-mermaid-the-witch-and-the-sea-by-maggie-tokuda-hall/">The Mermaid, the Witch and the Sea</a> by Maggie Tokuda-Hall was a fast read with some interesting gender dynamics and a different take on mermaids, but I will probably not remember anything about it in a few months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone in a book community I&rsquo;m in praised P. Djeli Clark&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.tor.com/2016/05/18/a-dead-djinn-in-cairo/">A Dead Djinn in Cairo</a>, which made me realise I&rsquo;d only read the sequel, <a href="https://publishing.tor.com/thehauntingoftramcar015-djelipclark/9781250294784/">The Haunting of Tram Car 015</a>. Read both of them this time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new T. Kingfisher book showed up in my recommendations, and I bought it on the strength of the title, <a href="http://www.redwombatstudio.com/portfolio/writing/books-for-adults/a-wizards-guide-to-defensive-baking/">The Wizard&rsquo;s Guide to Defensive Baking</a>. It&rsquo;s a whimsical and sometimes creepy read, which the author&rsquo;s note describes as a kid&rsquo;s book too dark to be published as a kid&rsquo;s book. Reminded me that I like the work published as Kingfisher, so re-read some that I already had, and ended up buying every other book that&rsquo;s set in this world.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36618062-clockwork-boys">Clockwork Boys</a>: I&rsquo;d bought and read this a while ago but didn&rsquo;t remember much about it, so read it again. Part 1 of a series so kind of a weird ending.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38352077-the-wonder-engine">The Wonder Engine</a> Part 2 of Clocktaur Wars, a much more satisfying conclusion after reading the whole thing.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.redwombatstudio.com/portfolio/writing/books-for-adults/minor-mage/">Minor Mage</a> Described as &ldquo;My first kid&rsquo;s book that was also too dark to be a kid&rsquo;s book&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.redwombatstudio.com/portfolio/writing/books-for-adults/swordheart/">Swordheart</a> By this point I was all in on Kingfisher books set in this world. Swordheart has all the beats of a romance novel, where one of the protagonists is a magic sword.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.redwombatstudio.com/portfolio/writing/books-for-adults/paladins-grace/">Paladin&rsquo;s Grace</a> The sequel to <em>Swordheart</em> isn&rsquo;t out yet, but this is potentially the start of a new series with overlapping characters?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/52654173-half-a-soul">Half a Soul</a> by Olivia Atwater is a Regency romance, but with magic, which means I immediately read it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d bought <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/45299217-anhaga">Anhaga</a> by Lisa Henry quite a while ago but didn&rsquo;t have time to read it and then forgot it in my backlog. Sweet queer fantasy romance, though not much happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like Zen Cho, so picked up <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250269256">The Order of the Pure Moon Reflected in Water</a> Not my favourite by Cho, but well-drawn depiction of a war-torn, Malaysia-influenced fantasy world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="articles">Articles</h1>
<ul>
<li>This year I learned that <a href="https://speakingrights.ca/blog/2020/august-1st-emancipation-day">August 1 is Emancipation Day in Canada</a>, after the day in 1834 when the British government abolished slavery across the empire.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whimsical-art">Whimsical art</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This charming article by George Cave exhaustively classifies the <a href="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/2020/LEGO-Interface-UX/">UX of lego interface panels</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr Eleanor Janega has another <a href="https://going-medieval.com/2020/08/07/plague-police-round-up-or-i-am-tired-and-you-people-give-me-no-peace/">hilarious post about people getting medieval history wrong</a>, in this case mostly focusing on plagues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this font <a href="https://fontbundles.net/creativemedialab/535208-losta-masta-playful-serif-family">Losta Masta</a> though I have no idea on earth what I would do with it if I bought it. I just like ligatures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leadership">Leadership</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Marianne Bellotti has an interesting take that <a href="https://medium.com/@bellmar/why-is-this-idiot-running-my-engineering-org-c6e815790cdb">good leadership requires embracing risk and fear</a>, and claims that the stereotypical incompetence of many leaders is due to how risk-averse people react to being responsible for large risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lara Hogan&rsquo;s <a href="https://leaddev.com/four-steps-identifying-your-new-role">Four steps to identifying your next role</a> could be valuable even if you&rsquo;re not actively job hunting, to try to identify what is working or not working about your current role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the sudden scramble for remote learning, I found this article on <a href="https://theeffortfuleducator.com/2020/07/31/principles-to-improve-the-effectiveness-of-instructional-videos/">evidence-based principles for improving the effectiveness of video instruction</a> to be interesting, and might apply to my attempts to Twitch stream. My heart goes out to students and teachers this year though.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-source">Open source</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fred Hebert has an in-depth piece about <a href="https://ferd.ca/inclusiveness-in-language-for-outsiders-looking-in.html">why inclusive language matters in open source</a> from the perspective of explaining to open source maintainers who are not at the forefront of wokeness why this stuff is important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was pretty crushed when I heard about last week&rsquo;s Mozilla layoffs, and concern about the future of Rust was a small part of that. I appreciated the Rust Core Team&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/08/18/laying-the-foundation-for-rusts-future.html">outline of the future of Rust</a> and the reassurance that the language will keep going.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ethical-technology">Ethical technology</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gilad Edelman wrote a long piece using the experience of the Dutch public broadcaster NPO to argue that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/can-killing-cookies-save-journalism/">getting rid of ad tracking cookies can lead to greater advertising revenues</a>, which would be a powerful shift in online privacy if it were to catch on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Somewhat horrified by this new research that shows <a href="https://kottke.org/20/08/researchers-can-duplicate-keys-from-the-sounds-they-make-in-locks">it&rsquo;s possible to duplicate keys from a recording of the sound it makes while sliding into a lock</a>. Along with previous research that people can reconstruct sound based on seeing tiny vibrations in random objects, it&rsquo;s starting to feel like all security and privacy is imaginary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another piece from Marianne Bellotti that&rsquo;s a little about the ethics of working for a defense contractor and a lot about <a href="https://medium.com/@bellmar/making-ai-better-by-making-it-slower-34e09ba9fcb9">how AI outcomes could be less terrible if we stopped trying to automate the wrong problems</a>, using Daniel Kahneman&rsquo;s model of human thinking as two modes, fast and slow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="programming-language-wonkery">Programming language wonkery</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fascinated by Jaana Dogan&rsquo;s twitter thread about <a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1293026308524584960?s=20">how new languages get productionized at Google</a>, which seems to be an arduous (but thorough) process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frustrated by the inadequate handling of GOPATH dependency downloads on a locked-down corporate network, was intrigued by Tyler Bui-Palsulich&rsquo;s assertion that <a href="https://dev.to/tbpalsulich/why-go-modules-are-faster-than-gopath-blj">Go modules are faster as well as being more flexible</a>. Not familiar enough with Go to feel confident recommending this to others but definitely going to play with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realise I needed Sheshbabu Chinnakonda&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-module-system/">clear explanation of the Rust module system</a> but it sure would have saved me some trial and error on my Rust project last week if I&rsquo;d read this first.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blogging">Blogging</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monica Lent as part of her Blogging for Devs series wrote an incredibly in-depth piece about <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/link-building-strategies/">how links to your website improve your page&rsquo;s ranking, and how to get those links</a>. It includes enough information that I know this link won&rsquo;t benefit Monica much because I have too many other links on this page!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stephanie Morillo&rsquo;s post on <a href="https://dev.to/radiomorillo/how-to-manage-your-fear-of-writing-and-publishing-new-content-1o2o">getting over the fear of publishing new content</a> is focused more on popularity than I am, but I could probably take some of this advice to get over my failure to finish any type of blog post except link collections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-depth-technical-reads">In-depth technical reads</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I like Anit Shrestha Manandhar&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/codeanit/til">Today I Learned git repository</a>, which is an interesting way of collecting knowledge, much of it on similar topics to what I tend to research. Perhaps something like this would be a better way of structuring my thoughts on what I learn?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This epic post by Catherine West about <a href="https://kyren.github.io/2018/09/14/rustconf-talk.html">using Rust for game development</a> was a fascinating meander through a lot of game programming concepts I was unfamiliar with, and brushed upon (but did not directly address) the reasons I started fighting with the borrow checker while working on my Rust project last week. I don&rsquo;t think West ever defines &ldquo;ECS&rdquo; in the post, so I looked it up (entity component system).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tyler Neely&rsquo;s <a href="http://sled.rs/perf">sled theoretical performance guide</a> is a massive document that I might have been able to absorb better if it were half a dozen blog posts, but it was still funny, and insightful, and full of interesting links for more information about performance in any language, but maybe specifically in Rust.</p>
</li>
