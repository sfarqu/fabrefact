    <p>Finally got my CI pipeline working with Hugo! Next step is to start writing something other than link posts, but in the meantime: here's another link post.</p>
<p>Even if no one else ever reads these posts this habit has proven invaluable to <em>me</em>, because it's easier for me to share that interesting article I was reading the other day now that I have a list of them online.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A few chapters into <a href="https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/">Dare to Lead</a> by Brené Brown (audiobook). Still searching for a business book that does not set my teeth on edge with business jargon. This is not that book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charity Majors offers advice on <a href="https://charity.wtf/2019/12/17/questionable-advice-how-do-i-get-my-team-into-observability/">how to get your developers on board with observability</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's a lot to unpack in this article about <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613305/this-chip-was-demoed-at-jeff-bezoss-secretive-tech-conference-it-could-be-key-to-the-future/">the new AI-optimized chip Vivienne Sze demoed at &ldquo;an elite, invite only conference&rdquo;</a>. There's currently a race to design more efficient chip architectures for specific algorithms—interesting. Given the many Twitter threads I've seen about the lack of ethics in AI, also a candidate for Dystopian Hellscape Weekly, along with: Amazon has a secret tech conference full of technology co-funded by DARPA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am utterly captivated by the idea of <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions">architecture decision records</a> as envisioned by Michael Nygard (this <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/distribute-design-authority-with-architecture-decision-records/">longer interview</a> explores how they worked in practice.) I want to retroactively add ADRs to every project I've ever had to do forensic psychology on to piece together architecture decisions out of terse changelist messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nora Jones suggested this <a href="https://bmcanesthesiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12871-019-0913-5">study comparing structured briefings to checklists in medical emergencies</a> could apply to software incident response. The study showed that briefings and checklists were about equally effective in getting to a correct solution within a limited time, but that briefings might allow people to feel more in control of what to do next if the first thing doesn't work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rereading Esther Derby's piece on <a href="https://www.estherderby.com/control-and-creativity/">control vs creativity</a> a few times and thinking about how to internalize this and relax my own tendency to want to control instead of delegate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chris McDermott wrote about <a href="https://medium.com/@chrisvmcd/mapping-maturity-create-context-specific-maturity-models-with-wardley-maps-informed-by-cynefin-37ffcd1d315">creating maturity models using Wardley Maps and the Cynefin framework</a> which was intriguing enough that I finally watched <a href="https://vimeo.com/189984496">a video from Simom Wardley</a> to figure out WTF a Wardley Map is, because I keep seeing the design/architecture/leadership parts of my Twitter feed talking about them. Video was entertaining but I still don't know how to <em>make</em> such a map. Also haven't looked up Cynefin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chelsea Troy wrote about <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/01/01/boundaries-2-assisted-processing/">setting boundaries for professional venting</a> and I immediately shared it with a bunch of friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm starting to think a lot about what I want my career to look like down the road, so Anna Shipman's post on <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/finding-next-level-job.html">finding a higher-level tech job</a> was interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a similar note someone linked to <a href="https://keavy.com/work/thriving-on-the-technical-leadership-path/">Keavy McMinn's post about what technical leadership roles can look like</a> and I immediately remembered reading it before, but I still read it again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I made it through Sanjay Sha's <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3374665">The Reliability of Enterprise Applications</a> but it was a bit of a slog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I might have accidentally made some new goals under the pressure of this time of year, and I'm reflecting on <a href="https://medium.com/@cwodtke/personal-okrs-three-years-later-7616e60574a4">Christina Wodtke's personal OKR process</a> to see if it might suit me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While compiling this list I ended up reading more of Chelsea Troy's blog, and this post from her Listening series about <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2019/11/25/listening-6-deliberate-inquisition/">deliberate inquisition</a> seems like something I specifically need to practice.</p>
