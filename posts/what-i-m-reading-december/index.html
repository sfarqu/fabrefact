    <p>What better time than holidays with the family to hide in your room writing blog posts? I got my work-provided login to O'Reilly's online learning portal to work on my iPad without SSO, so now I have a lot more technical books available to me when I travel!</p>
<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://beleaderly.com/woman-of-influence/"><em>Woman of Influence: 9 Steps to Build Your Brand, Establish Your Legacy, and Thrive</em></a> by Jo Miller - This was neither as cloying as I feared nor as practical as I'd hoped, but I still may recommend it to our new women's resource group. I liked how Miller is pragmatic about what is (and is not) within your control your career, however I found the exercises in each chapter a little vague.</li>
<li><em>Moonwalking With Einstein</em> by Joshua Foer (audiobook) - a biographical yarn about a pack of assholes (otherwise known as 25-year-old white men) that incidentally tells you how to memorize the order of a deck of playing cards. CW casual use of transphobic slurs. Do not recommend.</li>
<li><a href="https://annleckie.com/novel/the-raven-tower/"><em>The Raven Tower</em></a> by Ann Leckie - Read this earlier this year and adored it, so picked up a copy for myself as part of my Christmas shopping. Realised that I do not actually care at all about Mawat's story, so I mostly skipped that and instead read the bits where the Strength and Patience of the Hill describes its own experiences. I read those parts twice.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/agile-application-security/9781491938836/"><em>Agile Application Security: Enabling Security in a Continuous Delivery Pipeline</em></a> by Laura Bell, Jim Bird, Rich Smith, and Michael Brunton-Spall - Turns out I read this back in July? But logging into O'Reilly again I'm skimming everything on my lists and clearly I had forgotten huge chunks of this. I think I understand both CI/CD and security better than I did the first time I went through it. Look forward to bringing some of this into my work in the new year</li>
<li><a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/sysperfbook.html"><em>Systems Performance: Enterprise and the Cloud</em></a> by Brendan Gregg - Only a few chapters in but this is already very helpful to me! I wish I'd known about this book a year or two ago when I wanted to performance test something but didn't know where to start. I'm planning to read Gregg's <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/bpf-performance-tools-book.html">new BPF book</a> but wanted to read this one for background first.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="articles">Articles</h3>
<ul>
<li>A piece from Catalyst about <a href="https://www.catalyst.org/research/actions-men-can-take-to-create-an-inclusive-workplace/">actions men can take to create an inclusive workplace</a> is getting added to the resource list for one of my current projects.</li>
<li>I liked this post from Emily Nakashima about <a href="https://honkathon.com/2014-07-25-sunset-testing-for-short-lived-code/">&ldquo;sunset testing&rdquo;</a>, aka how to remind yourself to remove that gross temporary hack from your code.</li>
<li>Victoria Tran of Kitfox Games wrote a great <a href="https://medium.com/kitfox-games/an-introverts-guide-to-networking-971676958352">introvert's guide to networking</a> from the perspective of going to tech/gaming events for professional purposes.</li>
<li>Nicky Wrightson has a fascinating post about <a href="https://medium.com/@SkyscannerEng/finding-the-steps-on-the-individual-contributor-ladder-8ec60e11fb46">what a principal engineer is and how to find such roles</a></li>
<li>Stephanie Morillo has some good advice on <a href="https://www.stephaniemorillo.co/post/2019/02/17/7-common-content-marketing-mistakes-developers-make-and-how-to-avoid-them">content marketing for developers</a>, if what you're trying to do is build a brand as a developer advocate. I'm still not certain that's where I'm trying to go, but I do prefer to communicate effectively.</li>
<li>Vallery Lancey briefly outlines an interesting scenario which can cause <a href="https://timewitch.net/post/2019-12-17-autoscaling-cascade/">autoscaling groups to cascade out of control</a> and a couple high-level concepts for how to prevent this. I might want to diagram this to understand it better?</li>
<li>Still looking for an opportunity to use Laura Klein's <a href="https://www.usersknow.com/blog/2019/10/2/make-better-product-decisions">framework for making better product decisions</a> It seems deceptively simple, but I'm going to have to read this a few more times to see how to fit it into our slightly-different-than-described product cycle.</li>
<li>Julia Evans <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/how-tracking-pixels-work/">explains how tracking pixels work</a> with her characteristic clarity and enthusiasm!</li>
<li>Chelsea Troy has some interesting opinions about <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2019/12/18/reviewing-pull-requests/">how to review pull requests</a> which indicate a vastly different code review dynamic than I have ever experienced, but one that intrigued me. After reading the linked post about <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2019/12/13/async-collaboration-1-submitting-pull-requests/">how to include context in pull requests</a> I am frankly dying to try to incorporate this type of collaboration in my workplace.</li>
<li>A Slack group I'm in shared Anisha Sekar's <a href="https://humaninterest.com/blog/startup-equity-basics-ask-stock-accept/">Startup Equity Basics</a> as a list of things to ask about stock options before accepting an offerâ€”absolutely none of which I knew when I accepted an offer at a startup, so I lucked out by getting any benefit at all.</li>
<li>Chelsea Troy (again) has a <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2018/05/24/why-your-efforts-to-make-your-company-inclusive-arent-working/">rubric for evaluating team members on contributing to an inclusive culture</a>, with some invaluable ideas on how to be more scientific about &ldquo;is this human decent to work with&rdquo;.</li>
<li>This Signal blog post on <a href="https://signal.org/blog/secure-value-recovery/">secure value recovery</a> takes a walk through cloud storage, techniques to prevent brute-forcing of cryptographic keys, and secure enclaves, before circling around to one of my favourite topics: distributed consensus. Joshua Lund then describes how they implemented the Raft protocol in Rust. Honestly I only understood about half of this but I look forward to coming back to it in a few months.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="and-a-few-more-things-since-i-started-this-post-last-night">And a few more things since I started this post last night</h3>
<p>Trying to dig through all the unread links in my reading list during any holiday downtime:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't remember where I saw the recommendation that all developers should read Richard I. Cook's short paper <a href="http://web.mit.edu/2.75/resources/random/How%20Complex%20Systems%20Fail.pdf">How Complex Systems Fail</a> but I concur.</li>
<li>Thinking about the meaning of &ldquo;beautiful code&rdquo; after reading this small qualitative study about <a href="https://lectoraatchangemanagement.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/acm_conference_proceedings__master__template.pdf">the role of aesthetics in code</a>.</li>
<li>The latest issue of ACM Queue has a piece by Pat Helland on <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3364509">the tradeoffs between read and write speeds in database architectures</a> which sounded interesting, but no matter how many times I read the section on log-structured merge trees I still don't grok how LSM merges work. Hoping the Database Internals book I have on my reading list will help me out.</li>
<li><a href="https://labs.thisdot.co/blog/the-benefits-of-mentorship-for-developers">The Benefits of Mentorshop for Developers</a> by Jay Phelps has some interesting tips on mentorship from a different perspective than the general, non-tech-focused mentorship advice I've seen elsewhere.</li>
<li>Darius Kazemi, continuing to make me feel like a slacker who will never accomplish anything, spent 2019 <a href="https://write.as/365-rfcs/365-ietf-rfcs-a-50th-anniversary-dive">reading and blogging about the first 365 RFCs ever written by ARPANET engineers</a>, a project I just heard about today, when he completed it.</li>
<li>Cindy Sridharan posted <a href="https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1210024957117263873">a cool framework for diagramming hyped tech trends</a> that I now want to borrow for everything.</li>
<li>I still haven't learned enough about GraphQL to work with it, but this article on <a href="https://lab.wallarm.com/graphql-batching-attack/">GraphQL batching attacks</a> makes me want to read the whole series on security concerns for this API architecture.</li>
<li>Ian Wilkes wrote a piece for the Honeycomb.io blog about <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/secondary-storage-to-just-storage/">how they sped up large queries without breaking the bank</a> through a combination of AWS Lambda, efficient compression algorithms, and better garbage collection.</li>
