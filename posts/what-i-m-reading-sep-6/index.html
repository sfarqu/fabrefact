    <p>Oh no friends, I found a huge cache of unread links in my inbox. On average I spend four to eight hours putting together these posts, much of it reading articles that I've collected throughout the week. Time to be ruthless about what I consider interesting enough to give my attention to!</p>
<p>Hoping to resume streaming code on Twitch soon. Sundays seems like a likely time slot, so long as I can reign in my article reading to something manageable.</p>
<h1 id="books">Books</h1>
<ul>
<li>Instead of reading tech stuff I read four historical romances by Jeannie Lin last Tuesday. I often have trouble with romances outside of Regencies, which I imprinted on as a teen, but one of my favourite historical romance authors Courtney Milan was promoting Lin's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/108961-the-pingkang-li-mysteries">Lotus Palace mysteries</a>, a wuxia-inspired series set in Tang-dynasty China. It has all the delicious clothing details and elaborate etiquette rituals I want in a lighthearted read, and murder mysteries to boot. Sometimes a little thin, but fun!</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="papers">Papers?</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/12/232881-bringing-the-web-up-to-speed-with-webassembly/fulltext">Bringing the Web Up to Speed with WebAssembly</a> is an introduction to Wasm that is maybe not quite a technical paper, but definitely not easy reading either. I'm glad I got through it, because I keep hearing about WebAssembly and wanting to know more about it, but I didn't understand pretty much anything in section 3, and now I need a nap.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="articles">Articles</h1>
<ul>
<li>Jessie Frazelle's column on <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3419941">the history of storage media</a> contained a lot of factoids I didn't know, including the existence of hand-woven rope memory in space?!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="performance-engineering">Performance engineering</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nikhil Thomas had a great blog post about how <a href="https://nthomas.org/2020-09-03-All-My-Good-Habits-Are-Bad/">high performance coding often conflicts with other coding best practices</a>. Still thinking about his disparagement of &ldquo;functional-lite&rdquo; JS, since I have been trying to learn this functional-ish JS style despite my intuition that it's inefficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malte Skarupke's extremely performance-wonky post about <a href="https://probablydance.com/2020/08/31/on-modern-hardware-the-min-max-heap-beats-a-binary-heap/">how mix-max heaps beat binary heaps on modern hardware</a> contained an refreshingly clear explanation of what a heap even is and how different types are implemented, along with a proof of his titular assertion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="career-moves">Career moves</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jen Hamilton provides an <a href="https://medium.com/jen-hamilton/do-you-have-any-questions-for-me-ac6a53da1f2">excellent starter list of questions for candidates to ask in interviews</a> along with guidance for creating your own list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An interesting thought experiment by Aaron Randall and Amy Phillips about <a href="https://humansplus.tech/building-the-perfect-tech-team/">how to build the perfect tech team</a> which starts by making <em>really, really sure</em> that you need to hire people at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daniel Miessler's post on <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/how-to-initiate-first-contact-with-a-mentor/">how to initiate contact with a mentor</a> has some interesting and useful tips, though the final example of &ldquo;offer an improvement to something they've made&rdquo; has a catastrophic failure mode of &ldquo;badly explain an expert's work back to them&rdquo;, and I would tend to avoid that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="system-architecture">System architecture</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Matt Klein's <a href="https://blog.envoyproxy.io/introduction-to-modern-network-load-balancing-and-proxying-a57f6ff80236">introduction to modern network load balancing and proxying</a> is absolute magic, and now I maybe have an inkling of what &ldquo;service mesh&rdquo; means. Interested to know what new developments have happened since 2017.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paulo Merson's <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/microservices-design-ideals/">principles for microservice design</a> provides an acronym (IDEALS) to remember architecture principles for microservices, and helpfully includes examples too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tools-for-developers">Tools for developers</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Katie Sylor-Miller wrote a piece about <a href="https://ksylor.github.io/2020/08/26/bullet-journaling.html">Bullet Journalling for software engineers</a> which is very close to my own experience with BuJo. I will fall off it for weeks or months at a time, but find it easier to pick back up again than any other organizational system. When I'm on top of my BuJo I get so much more done!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monica Powell has a quick explanation of <a href="https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/how-to-make-your-vs-code-sparkle">how to add sparkle typing effects to VS Code</a> using the Power Mode extension, which I had been craving but hadn't taken the time to look up how to add custom animations. Now my code is 90% sparklier!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="short-technical-dives">Short technical dives</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This <a href="https://www.netburner.com/learn/getting-back-on-the-horse-tls-session-resumption/">intro to resuming TLS sessions</a> by Dann McCreary gives a clear explanation of the different session persistence mechanisms in TLS 1.2 with an eye specifically on IoT implementations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alison Quaglia reveals some <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-truth-about-hoisting-in-js-8ac79a08a5f9">odd details about variable hoisting in Javascript and the Temporal Dead Zone</a>. Features many references to <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/2nd-ed/scope-closures">You Don't Know JS</a>, which I should really finish reading one of these days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still don't know what Glauber Costa's article on <a href="https://medium.com/@glaubercosta_11125/c-vs-rust-an-async-thread-per-core-story-28c4b43c410c">C++ vs Rust async bugs</a> has to do with thread-per-core, but I learned a little bit more about working with the Rust borrow checker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Trail of Bits post about <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2020/06/09/how-to-check-if-a-mutex-is-locked-in-go/">checking if a mutex is locked in Go</a> I don't think spends enough time emphasizing that this solution is only good for test assertions, not live code, but it is a potentially handy and concise trick.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leading-engineers">Leading engineers</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Andreas Klinger has a <a href="https://klinger.io/post/613532774806192128/how-i-think-about-code-management">compelling post about managing code to improve your codebase</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hesitated on including Sean J. Taylor's piece on <a href="https://medium.com/@seanjtaylor/designing-and-evaluating-metrics-5902ad6873bf">designing and evaluating metrics</a> because I found it a little dense and the Simpsons gifs off-putting, but I think there's valuable ideas here on properties of metrics worth evaluating before you try to use them to measure your organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mario Fernandez has practical advice about <a href="https://hceris.com/dev-huddle-as-a-tool-to-achieve-alignment-among-developers/">how and why to implement a &ldquo;dev huddle&rdquo; meeting with your team</a> that is making me think about my current meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ross Pettit's post on <a href="http://www.rosspettit.com/2020/08/legacy-modernization.html">legacy modernization</a> points out that the biggest hurdle of migrating legacy software is identifying a good enough value proposition to even start.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The other day I did a short tech talk about GraphQL (which was terrible but I'll talk about that another time), and one of the questions was how authorization is handled. I didn't have a ready answer but it seems to be&hellip;up to whoever's writing the server? Dominic Couture's post about <a href="https://blog.deesee.xyz/graphql/security/2020/04/13/graphql-permission-testing.html">how to enumerate paths to validate authorization logic</a> indicates that this is a running security concern with GraphQL implementations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I pretty much never feel like watching talks, so I'm definitely missing context by reading the slides from Stefan Edwards and Bobby Tonic's presentation on <a href="https://github.com/lojikil/kyoto-go-nihilism/blob/master/go-ing-for-a-stroll/presentation.md">vulnerabilities in Go</a> but I still learned some tips! Mostly that I don't understand anything about <code>defer</code>.</p>
