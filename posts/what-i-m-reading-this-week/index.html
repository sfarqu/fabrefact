The $10m engineering problem, blog post about how Segment cut their infrastructure costs by 30%

I found this fascinating! Hope to come back to it as I learn more about infrastructure design to see what else I can get out of it.

<p><em>Deep Work: rules for focused success in a distracted world</em> by Cal Newport (audiobook)</p>
<ul>
<li>This book mostly made me angry, but buried in the endless tedious anecdotes about white men being successful is at least a blog post's worth of good advice.</li>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/how-a-months-old-amd-microcode-bug-destroyed-my-weekend/">How a months-old AMD microcode bug destroyed my weekend</a> Ars Technica article about a bug in certain AMD processors whose onboard random number generator always returns the same value</p>

<p><em>Doing Good Better: effective altruism and how you can make a difference</em> by William MacAskill (audiobook)</p>
<ul>
<li>I was on board with this technique until he said one should <em>never</em> allow personal feelings toward an issue to influence your charitable giving. As I am still interested in effective altruism I will keep listening, but with greater skepticism.</li>

<li>This one digs pretty deep and I decided to come back to it after I finish the work about CPU architecture I have on hold</li>

<li>I never did learn networking properly in school, but I seem to be finding a flurry of sources on protocols and algorithms so maybe it's time to stop being intimidated by the topic</li>
