<li>turns out scripts are constantly scraping my app looking for admin pages or vulns!

<li>finally put code on github in case something happens to my computer</li>
<li>looks like JVB has a memory leak? memory usage increases permanently after every CPU spike

<ul>
<li>looked at malleus, going to take some Java work to try to make it test my frontend</li>
<li>manual testing by opening a bunch of windows first
<ul>
<li>default config starts dropping connections at &gt;4 people in conference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can keep a permanent loadbalancer while killing the rest of the stack
<ul>
<li>Use <code>x-aws-loadbalancer</code> as a top-level element in your Compose file to set the ARN of an existing LoadBalancer.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3 id="sunday-february-7">Sunday, February 7</h3>
<ul>
<li>trying out new cloudformation configs
<ul>
<li>permanent load balancer, set using <code>x-aws-loadbalancer</code>
<ul>
<li>took a long time for this to stabilize after bringing up, but seems to work now</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>setting HTTP2Preferred on TLS endpoint
<ul>
<li>broke everything, probably because of the hack to make non-SSL port 443 in nginx.</li>
<li>need to figure out how to re-encrypt traffic to instance while still keeping ELB certificate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>greater capacity for JVB server (8Gb RAM)
<ul>
<li>problem seems to be CPU, not RAM, but 8Gb is recommended for high load</li>
<li>can&rsquo;t set both CPU and memory, so going with RAM</li>
<li>setting 8Gb forces 1vCPU, rather than default of .25 or .5</li>

<h4 id="oh-no-a-big-problem">Oh no a big problem</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can&rsquo;t seem to stably handle more than 4 concurrent users
<ul>
<li>jicofo reports that users are sending &ldquo;MemberLeft&rdquo; messages &ldquo;Chat room event ChatRoomMemberPresenceChangeEvent&rdquo;</li>
<li>JS: Lots of &ldquo;Ping timeout&rdquo; from modules/xmpp/strophe.ping.js</li>
<li>JS: Often gets stuck in &ldquo;Bridge Channel send: no opened channel.&rdquo; from modules/RTC/BridgeChannel.js (groups of 4 every 10s)
THEORY: nginx connections get saturated, leading to timeouts
<ul>
<li>default configs for Fargate task of .25 vCPU probably means work gets blocked if co-sharing</li>
<li>tried creating a second task instance, but HTTPS traffic was never routed to it (WHY?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>turning on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-access-logs.html">access logs for ELB</a></li>

<h3 id="thursday-february-11">Thursday, February 11</h3>
<ul>
<li>trying to figure out why connections dropping
<ul>
<li>testing locally
<ul>
<li>local build requires local environment variables to be built into JS project
<ul>
<li>add <code>path</code> parameter to <code>Dotenv</code> instantiation in <code>webpack.config</code> to set to <code>.env.local</code></li>
<li>rebuild docker container for local tag <code>docker- build -t sfarqu/party-app:latest .</code></li>
<li>use docker-compose and local .env file <code>docker--compose --env-file .env.local up -d</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5 connections locally seem to run fine, but tons of &ldquo;Bridge Channel send: no opened channel.&rdquo; errors
<ul>
<li>probably related to &ldquo;Firefox canâ€™t establish a connection to the server at wss://meet.chicazul.com/colibri-ws/172.25.0.5/&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>does this mean that app is failing to set up videobridge connections and is instead using P2P?
<ul>
<li>that could explain why local is way more stable that AWS version</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NEW INVESTIGATION TRACK: figure out why colibri websocket connections are failing</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t recall consistently seeing that error in AWS version, so may be red herring</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Investigating &ldquo;connection interrupted&rdquo; error in <code>lib-jitsi-meet</code>
<ul>
<li>sometimes it was a different error, so it&rsquo;s not just this thing, but it was an issue</li>
<li>both P2P errors and JVB errors throw the same interruption message.</li>
<li>in theory interruptions should be recoverable&hellip;how?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="about-this-series">About this series</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Back in mid-December I started an ambitious project to create a custom platform for a virtual birthday party in February. I kept notes on my progress, both for personal reference and to turn into a series of blog posts. It quickly became apparent that I did not have time to both <em>do the project</em> and <em>blog about the project</em>. I have retroactively decided to post my raw notes as a dev log.</p>
