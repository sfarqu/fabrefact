    <p>This felt like a slow reading week since I got sick and spent a lot of time not wanting to do anything more strenuous than play phone games, and didn't finish either book that I'm working through. Sunday morning make-coffee-and-read-articles is becoming a relaxing ritual though.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Been slogging through Don Norman's <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-everyday-things-revised-and-expanded-edition">The Design of Everyday Things</a> (audiobook), since I've encountered most of these concepts beforeâ€”in works that were probably inspired by the first edition of this book, to be fair. Later in the book there's some good content about resilience engineering that kept my attention a little better. Lesson learned: always skip the preface in audiobooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn't feel like I had the time to attend the local Global Diversity CFP event but I'm glad Wen Cai <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-become-tech-conference-speaker-key-takeaways-from-wen-cai">wrote a post summarizing the key lessons</a> of the experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-read Suz Hinton's <a href="https://increment.com/development/a-guide-to-coding-accessible-developer-tools/">guide to coding accessible developer tools</a>, which has a lot of good things to keep in mind for any project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jon Cutler's <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/the-messy-shift-to-starting-together-61088323b896">post on &ldquo;starting together&rdquo;</a> was less focused than I'd hoped from the tweet that led me to it, but has valuable takeaways about how to shift a team from a top-down to an autonomous mindset. The most important point being that this is hard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking for good guidelines on documentation led me to Gene Hughson's <a href="https://genehughson.wordpress.com/2014/01/13/your-code-is-not-enough/">Your Code is not Enough</a>, which mostly sells the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of documentation but at the end gets a little into &ldquo;how&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More practical advice can be found in Stephanie Blotner's <a href="https://increment.com/documentation/primer-on-documentation-content-strategy/">primer on documentation content strategy</a> on Increment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't have kids of my own but I still <a href="https://twitter.com/iproposethis/status/1161130456286289920?s=20">worry about how to keep teens from being groomed by white supremacists on social media</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though I don't love watching talks, I might have to go through Cindy Sridharan's <a href="https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/best-of-2019-in-tech-talks-bac697c3ee13">Best of 2019 in Tech Talks</a> because they all sound amazing. (I saw one of these live!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always looking for beginner-friendly security content, and while Troy Hunters <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/locking-down-your-website-scripts-with-csp-hashes-nonces-and-report-uri/">overview of using content security policies</a> isn't quite as accessible as I'd like, it's not bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had Gregor Hohpe's treatise on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/oss-lockin.html">the perils of trying to avoid lock-in</a> open in my browser for a while. Glad I finally got around to reading it because it's both insightful and funny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also funny was Jan Schaumann's tweet thread about <a href="https://www.netmeister.org/blog/ops-lessons.html">Ops lessons we all learn the hard way</a>, collected here into a blog post. I've never even been Ops but I can still relate to some of these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was hoping for more out of Farnam Street's <a href="https://fs.blog/smart-decisions/">framework for making smarter decisions</a>, which makes a case for people being bad at decisions but, despite the title, does not actually explain how to do better. It does however have a lot of links at the end which may be more promising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teri Radichel has an interesting two-part post about <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-and-threats/why-patching-software-is-hard-technical-challenges-/a/d-id/1330181">why patching software in a large organization is hard</a> with the first part addressing the technical challenges and <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/why-patching-software-is-hard-organizational-challenges/a/d-id/1330182">the second looking at organizational issues</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elizabeth Ayer advocates for <a href="https://medium.com/@ElizAyer/dont-ask-forgiveness-radiate-intent-d36fd22393a3">&ldquo;radiating intent&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;begging forgiveness&rdquo;</a> as a healthier attitude toward taking action without waiting for permission. I like that she at least nods to how this strategy might not work for everyone though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jon Moore elaborates on Coda Hale's piece I linked last week with <a href="https://blog.jonm.dev/posts/universal-scalability-for-orgs/">some more math about organizational scalability</a> which points to contention for shared resources and coherence/communication overheads as limiting factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keavy McMinn has a great post about <a href="https://keavy.com/work/technical-preparation/">how she approaches technical research when solving engineering problems</a>. Her advocacy of &ldquo;spikes&rdquo; makes me think of the second divergence phase of the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/double-diamond">double diamond design model</a>, which apparently makes at least one thing I'll take away from The Design of Everyday Things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://goslings.tech">Christian Carter</a> generously shared some of the resources he's using to learn to write a Go web app, and I started with Jon Calhoun's <a href="https://www.calhoun.io/using-the-service-object-pattern-in-go/">Using the Service Object Pattern in Go</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jessica Kerr talks about <a href="https://blog.jessitron.com/2020/01/24/capturing-the-world-in-software/">why to use event sourcing architectures</a> even though they are not more scalable, faster, or simpler than the alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I enjoyed Radhika Morabia's <a href="https://radhika.dev/anti-workaholics-guide/">Anti-Workaholic's Guide to Getting Ahead</a>, which is a very pragmatic (if cynical) approach to how to build skills without burning yourself out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last year I read <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3355369.3355604">an intriguing paper</a> on how Google's new congestion control algorithm for QUIC was unfair to TCP traffic, but lead author Ranysha Ware just published <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2020/01/24/modelling-bbrs-interactions-with-loss-based-congestion-control/">a new article about the research</a> that is much more comprehensible to a layperson!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mattias Verraes posits a <a href="http://verraes.net/2020/01/wall-of-technical-debt/">strategy for making tech debt visible</a> that unfortunately I don't think will fly in my office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liz Fong-Jones&rsquo; Honeycomb blog post about <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/treading-in-haunted-graveyards/">automating infrastructure-as-code deploys</a> was a little over my head because I don't know the first thing about Terraform, but I was sucked in by the reference to haunted graveyards in the title and learned a bit about optimizing cloud hosting bills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
