    <p>Have spent more time on home-improvement projects than article-reading in the past few weeks, but it felt like time to pull the plug on the current list of stuff-to-read. It has been hard to focus on tech stuff during the tension of the US election. Coming up in the next few weeks I expect to be distracted by <a href="https://desertbus.org/">Desert Bus For Hope</a> and the <a href="https://worldbuilders.org/blog/2020-end-of-year-fundraiser-dates-announced/">Worldbuilders end of year fundraiser</a>, so I shouldn&rsquo;t get my hopes too high about a reading resurgence until the holidays.</p>
<p>Just learned about <a href="https://libro.fm/">libro.fm</a> as a non-Amazon source for audiobooks, but I also just used up a big cache of Audible credits so may take a while to really make use of it.</p>
<h1 id="books">Books</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Started the audiobook of <a href="http://radicalmarkets.com/">Radical Markets: Uprooting capitalism and democracy for a just society</a>, but can&rsquo;t quite remember what compelled me to add it to my shopping cart. I&rsquo;m not big on economics, and I&rsquo;m not certain I&rsquo;ll be able to follow the arguments being made in audio format, but may as well try. Not sure I&rsquo;m sold on the premise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tend to hopscotch around in O&rsquo;Reilly books when I&rsquo;m looking for bed-time reading and not stick with one book for long, but I might dig more into Eben Hewitt&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/technology-strategy-patterns/9781492040866/">Technology Strategy Patterns</a>. It&rsquo;s not precisely riveting reading, but I&rsquo;ve been able to at least vaguely follow along even though I mostly only read it as I&rsquo;m preparing to fall asleep.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="short-fiction">Short fiction</h1>
<ul>
<li>Intrigued by Sumana Harihareswara&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2020/10/28">project to post short fiction recommendations every day</a>, I went through the list and read a bunch of stories when I was supposed to be doing something else.
<ul>
<li>Veronica Schanoes <a href="http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/the-regime-of-austerity/">The Regime of Austerity</a> was fine, but not particularly memorable.</li>
<li>Zen Cho&rsquo;s <a href="http://mascarareview.com/zen-cho/">The Four Generations of Chang E</a> was more melancholy than I expected after reading Cho&rsquo;s other works.</li>
<li>Claire Humphrey&rsquo;s <a href="http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/four-steps-to-the-perfect-smoky-eye/">Four Steps to the Perfect Smoky Eye</a> left me feeling unsettled. Hardly speculative at all.</li>
<li>T. Kingfisher&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.fantasy-magazine.com/new/new-fiction/the-dryads-shoe/">The Dryad&rsquo;s Shoe</a> was my favourite of the stories. I love quirky, funny fairytale retellings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="articles">Articles</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Em Lazer-Walker released her highly-anticipated (at least by me) breakdown of the design considerations that went into the <a href="https://dev.to/lazerwalker/using-game-design-to-make-virtual-events-more-social-24o">custom virtual social space for Roguelike Celebration</a>, which is highly relevant to my upcoming birthday plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I quite liked this list of <a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-40-best-questions-to-ask-in-an-interview-how-to-go-deeper-than-whats-the-culture-like/">thoughtful questions to ask in a job interview</a>, one of the many aspects of interviews I have never been any good at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pat Kua&rsquo;s post about <a href="https://www.patkua.com/blog/the-power-of-community/">the power of community in determining a good tool</a> crossed my path at about the same time as a conversation about why MySQL became so popular when it&rsquo;s not the best free database, which seemed serendipitous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stefan Judis points out a side-effect of new browser privacy protections: <a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/notes/say-goodbye-to-resource-caching-across-sites-and-domains/">the benefit of third-party CDNs for caching Javascript libraries and other resources will mostly disappear</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I immediately clicked through on Pam Selle&rsquo;s post on <a href="https://thewebivore.com/how-im-trying-to-stop-overcommitting/">how she stopped overcommitting to projects</a> because I have been extremely feeling this problem lately. Guess I need to start making Gantt charts instead of just lists in random text files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks to Allie Jones I now know that <a href="https://alliejon.es/blog/2020/10/30/smoother-remote-live-demos-with-obs">you can use OBS as a camera input in Zoom</a>, allowing all the fancy Twitch streamer setup I&rsquo;ve done to have another use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Julia Evans introduced <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/10/26/ninja--a-simple-way-to-do-builds/">a tiny build system called ninja</a>, and manages to make build systems seem approachable and like a think I can learn more about, instead of a foreign wizard mystery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brian Hicks' post about <a href="https://bytes.zone/posts/state-transition-tables/">discovering what state-transition tables are</a> taught me what state-transition tables are!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malte Skarupke has some fascinating <a href="https://probablydance.com/2020/11/08/looking-for-voter-fraud-in-old-elections-with-data-visualization/">data visualizations of electoral fraud</a>, contrasting the original graphs using Russian data (which display obvious fraud) with new graphs of US data, which does not show fraud, but instead indicates voter suppression.</p>
</li>
