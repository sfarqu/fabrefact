    <p>Instead of writing up my recent reading I spent most of today reading <em>more</em> things, which is not exactly how I intended this to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Molly Struve shares a specific story about migrating from Memcached to Redis, along with some <a href="https://dev.to/molly_struve/switching-from-memcache-to-redis-and-some-tips-on-caching-4g1l">cacheing best practices</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting on my reading list of dystopian tech books with Emily Chang's <a href="http://www.brotopiabook.com/">Brotopia</a> (audiobook). I expected this to retread a lot of ground I already knew, so was pleasantly surprised to instead learn a lot of details about Silicon Valley and how VC firms work that was new to me. Still lots of downer content and descriptions of assault and harassment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simon Wardley's tweet thread <a href="https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1213868373051875328">starts off in open source and ends up in dystopian techno-futurism</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Segun Ola makes a good point about <a href="https://twitter.com/segunolalive/status/1213953805454381061?s=20">where DIV tags still have value in semantic HTML</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chelsea Troy has been posting a lot and I have been reading all of it, but I especially liked this <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2020/01/06/posd-2-debugging-tactics/">post on debugging tactics</a> with a rant in the middle about how the software industry as a whole doesn't actually teach debugging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dan Lorenc posts eloquently about a topic I am currently invested in: <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/getting-serious-about-open-source-security-1d15609478fa">how to apply security to open source dependencies</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuing with dependencies, Pablo Díaz writes about a concept for <a href="https://medium.com/blogyuxiglobal/tracking-project-and-library-dependencies-with-graph-oriented-dbs-e55027d33adf">using a graph-oriented database to model software dependencies and identify issues</a>. This article was mostly a narrative about a problem the author solved and did not easily lend itself to steps to apply, but I think there's useful ideas here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love when people turn talks into blog posts! I am way more likely to read an article than watch a video, and Galo Navarro's talk on <a href="https://srvaroa.github.io/paas/infrastructure/platform/kubernetes/cloud/2020/01/02/talk-how-to-build-a-paas-for-1500-engineers.html">how to build a successful platform team in a large org</a> was worth looking at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Twitter engineering blog has a great post by Bryce Anderson and Ruben Oanta about <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2019/daperture-load-balancer.html">Twitter's new load balancing algorithm for their custom RPC system</a> complete with a lot of very helpful diagrams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://fionavoss.blog">Fiona Voss</a> asked for feedback on an interview question she had about scaling Twitter, which led me down a rabbit hole of wondering how <em>Twitter</em> scaled Twitter. I found this article about their architecture in 2013 in <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/7/8/the-architecture-twitter-uses-to-deal-with-150m-active-users.html">High Scalability</a>, and a Twitter engineering blog post from 2017 about their <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2017/the-infrastructure-behind-twitter-scale.html">infrastructure and ops</a> by Mazdak Hashemi, which is still a bit over my head.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dan Abramov has an evocative point about how <a href="https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/">clean code is not a goal in itself</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I greatly enjoyed Cindy Sridharan's <a href="https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/a-decade-in-review-in-tech-1cde76c9b43c">review of tech trends of the 2010s</a> and predictions of the future</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coda Hale blogged persuasively about <a href="https://codahale.com/work-is-work/">organizational performance as parallel systems</a> and what that means for growth. I liked the principles at the end of this one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be contrary, I then read Sonja Blignaut's metaphor of <a href="https://medium.com/@sonjablignaut/reconceptualising-organisations-from-complicated-machines-to-flowing-streams-c03e9e917f35">organizations as flow systems</a>, though I don't think the two articles express contradictory ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Esther Derby talks about <a href="https://www.estherderby.com/the-risks-of-anonymous-feedback/">the risks of anonymous feedback</a> among colleagues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edmund Lewry writes about how they <a href="https://clearblueskybox.wordpress.com/2020/01/05/becoming-a-technical-leader/">define a Tech Lead, while moving into that role</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This <a href="https://medium.com/@djpardis/management-and-coaching-best-practices-as-a-list-of-n-things-7a6d9c7f0fa5">list of coaching best practices</a> by Pardis Noorzad is clearly aimed at managers, but I think some of the advice is applicable to everyone who is trying to interact effectively with colleagues. (I take a little issue with the smile comment, but she's not wrong.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Denise Yu made and shared <a href="https://twitter.com/deniseyu21/status/1215695277237178369?s=20">a worksheet for writing a conference talk proposal</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I found <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi.html">Anna Shipman's blog</a> through one of her recent book reviews, but ended up reading a large section of her archives. I thought this post on <a href="https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/good-pull-requests.html">best practices for making a pull request</a> will be useful for me to reference as we migrate our codebase from Perforce to Github</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I recently had to go through the Byzantine password process at my work, so reading Emily Cain's article for Increment about how <a href="https://increment.com/security/password-security-best-practices/">password policies are terrible for security</a> was mostly cathartic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A long explanation of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution">the global problem plastic pollution</a> by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser is a little depressing but also provides data-based suggestions about what policies could make the biggest difference. (Banning straws does not even come close to making the list.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/vqyw6/">recent replication of Mueller and Oppenheimer's study</a> (about how taking notes longhand is better for your memory than typing on a computer) failed to replicate the same results. Another whole generation of pop-psychology books about the benefits of unplugging may turn out to be factually incorrect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checked out Fancy Fairy's tutorial for <a href="https://www.fancyfairy.com/fairywingtutorial">making fairy wings</a></p>
</li>
